# sunniExcels

## Introduction
___________

sunniExcels is a app created with love and enthusiasm. It is a community site for anyone interested in learning about Excel or for anyone interested in sharing their knowledge for Excel. Excel is not only for a company employee but can also be used for home businesses, personal project management, finances, etc. It can be used as a general calculator or to calculate a potential mortgage or car loan.
I first began to use Excel seriously at my first corporate job and since then have been using it in my personal life as well. I hope this site can help you learn and is a source of joy.
